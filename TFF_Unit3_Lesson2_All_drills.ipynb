    "#### Q1: Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: These are independent events. So they all have the same probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "P(HTTH) = P (HHHH) = P(TTHH) =  1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/16 \n",

    "Answer: P(not choosing a man) = 1-21/45 = 24/45\n",

    "#### Q4: A data scientist wants to study the behavior of users on the company website. Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: First of all, the sample data from the survey does not represent the population. There is only 5% chance that a user will be asked to enter a survey if they click a link. There is a possibility that a user does not click on any link and yet spend some time on the website just scrolling around, and even if a user clicks a link, there is only 5% chance that they will be asked to participate in a survey. Therefore, such a conclusion is not representative of the average user. Secondly, the longer the user remains on the website, there is more possibility that they would get a link for the survey. Therefore, the survey data may have more data points from such users and that would bias their self-reporting of how much time they spend on the website. \n",

    "A better alternative will be to keep track of each user from the time they arrive at the website until they leave.\n",

    "__(1) Data Source:__ Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: First of all, the availability data could look very different depending on the continent. In USA, Americans spend their time at home with families, whereas, non-Americans (dare I say, immigrants) take this oppotunity to explore popular landmarks. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Europe, 24th December could see similar trends. However, considering the fact that Amsterdam is a popular tourist destination, it is likely that the data for that day will give the impression that all neighborhoods in Amsterdam is popular because every Airbnb availability will be booked or overbooked. Another option could be that Airbnb hosts may not prefer to rent their places to guests on Christmas Eve. \n",

Looking at the column metrics for the data, I see the two most relevant columns (Prim_Imp) and (Sec_Imp) ask the questions: \"Which feature is of primary/secondary importance for you?\" These refer to the features of the pub, and does not reflect the pub-goer's reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative question: What are some of the profitable features of pubs that should be highlighted in advertisements? According to the column metrics of the data, pub-goers preferred ambiance/environment and the selection of music over menu or pricing, so a pub should advertisement those to attract more customers to their pub.  \n",
